# Tapping
This application was created to demonstrate the lessons (android features, shared preferences, menus, and alert dialogs) learned from the Mobile App Development and Strategy course.

The screen is divided into 2 regions, the left (blue) and the right (red). To gain points, each region should be tapped alternately.
